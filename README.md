# Project Overview
To simulate the behavioral analysis of the Online shoppers purchasing intention dataset, we developed the Drift diffusion model from scratch due to the constraints in implementing existing libraries. 
We modelled the population intention for the people who purchased the product and identified the mean and standard deviation for their Response times. To enhance the fitting of DDM on the data we estimated the parameters (Drift rate, Decision boundary and Gaussian noise) using linear estimation and trial calling. Additionally, we analysed the variation of drift rates for a
few specific “traffic types” and identified the traffic medium which ended with the quickest
purchase.
